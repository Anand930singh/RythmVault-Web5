Project Idea - Blockchain-Powered Royalty Platform for Artists: Build a decentralized platform using blockchain to manage and distribute royalties to artists directly. Smart contracts can automate royalty payments based on usage and sales of digital art and music, ensuring fair compensation and transparency for creators.
